# FIFA PROJECT

Project created by [Alba Nerea Mohedas](https://github.com/AlbaNMG), [Adolfo Carril](https://github.com/Jadcarpan) and [Sergio Parisi](https://github.com/parisisergio).  
  

In here we take the role of a Football Club with needs for a new player and two aproaches:  

- We have an injured CB and we need to buy new player as fast as possible. For that we have a 40Mâ‚¬ budget. We need the player to be under 25 so we can have a good player for longer time.  
- We want to try and buy a future star by checking the relation between the Overall Stats and Aged
